<label class="col-form-label">
Question: Who do you <b>expect</b> to perform better on <u>the verbal task</u>, men or women?
</label>

<br><br>
Slide the blue dot to the left if you expect men to perform better, and to the right if you expect women to perform better. <br>
If you are within a 10% range of the correct answer, you'll receive an extra potential payoff of â‚¬1.
<br><br>

For example: if you think men scored on average 10% better than women, slide the slider to 10% in favor of men. <br> 
This means that if women scored 100 points, men scored 110 points.
You will receive potential payoff if men performed between 5%-15% better than women, so between 105-115 points.
